# Introduction
Welcome to my Portfolio! As of now, most (if not all) of these projects were written in Python and have been ran in Jupyter Notebook.
I created this repository to showcase not only my learning, but also demonstrate different types of projects I can take on and apply my knowledge towards.
If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brian-unanan-167998204/).

## Required Libraries (Python)
You will need to install the following Python libraries in order for the code to function...

### For Statistical Analysis & Reporting Projects: 
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- (You will also need to import the Statsmodels API for the Bradley Beal project)

### Object-Oriented Projects:
- All you probably need is Pygame. This is because I personally like to make the projects at least engaging to the user and myself (when I'm building them out).
