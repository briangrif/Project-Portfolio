# Introduction
Welcome to my Portfolio! As of now, most (if not all) of these projects were written in Python and have been ran in Jupyter Notebook.
I created this repository to showcase not only my learning, but also demonstrate different types of projects I can take on and apply my knowledge towards.
If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brian-unanan-167998204/).

## Required Libraries (Python)
You will need to install the following Python libraries in order for the code to function...

### For Statistical Analysis & Reporting Projects: 
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- (You will also need to import the Statsmodels API for the Bradley Beal project)

### Object-Oriented Projects:
- All you probably need is Pygame. This is because I personally like to make the projects at least engaging to the user and myself (when I'm building them out).

## What's the Deal With Bradley Beal?
This project is based on Bradley Beal's 2022 SuperMax extension ($251 million dollar for 5 years) and how an analyst could've saved the Wizards from a SERIOUS financial mistake.
- The Purpose? To use basketball statistics and our own efficiency formula to showcase his regression going into his contract year.
- What data was used? Core statistics (PPG, RPG, APG) divided by 'Minutes' to give a efficiency rating for every possible chance he's on the court.
- How far does the data span? His entire Tenure with the Wizards (Rookie to SuperMax extension).
